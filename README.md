### What is SkyblockPy?
SkyblockPy is a simple Python API wrapper which is used to communicate and fetch data from the Hypixel Skyblock API endpoints.
It is based on the Python requests library, which makes it very simple to develop for and fix issues.

### How do I use SkyblockPy?
SkyblockPy works by communicating with the Hypixel API endpoints by using your **API key**. 

If no errors are returned by the API endpoint (status code 200 is returned), then the API output is returned as a `dict`.

### Obtaining an API key
Go to the Hypixel Minecraft Java server and use `/api` command.

### I found a bug/I want to add a missing feature!
